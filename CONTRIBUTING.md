# Contributing

Before making a pull request
1. Tidy your commits into the format below
2. Deploy the playbook your self (if you have permissions)
3. Does it work? If not, fix it and goto 1
4. Create a pull request :)

## Commit style

Please create commits for each logical change,
and use this format for your git commits

```
<role>: <task>: <change headline>

< more descriptive text >
```
example:
```
jumbotron: irssi: cleanup .irssi/config

Consistently indent everything with 2 spaces,
and add a newline at end of file.
```
